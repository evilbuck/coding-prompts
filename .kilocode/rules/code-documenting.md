# Documenting

## Overall Instruction

Be concise. Be accurate. Don't use 10 sentences when 1 will do. Clarity is valued.

## After a task is finished

Document the code changes in @docs/*.md

## Audiences

- End User (of the code)
- Architect


### End User

The end user documentation should be targeted and written for the end user.
It should explain how the code should be used.

### Architect

This documentation should be allow an engineer to understand the underpinning of the task.
It's architecture and how it works. It should be clear enough so that a junior developer can
make changes in the future.
